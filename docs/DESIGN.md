# Blockchain System Design

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Components
- **Client Node**: Handles transaction processing, mining, and peer communication
- **Tracker Server**: Manages peer discovery and network coordination
- **Blockchain Core**: Implements block creation, validation, and chain management
- **Network Layer**: Handles peer-to-peer communication and synchronization

### 1.2 Data Structures

#### Blockchain Structure
```python
{
    "chain": List[Block],           # List of blocks in the chain
    "pending_transactions": List[Dict], # List of pending transactions
    "difficulty": int,              # Current mining difficulty
    "target_block_time": int,       # Target time between blocks
    "block_times": List[float],     # List of recent block mining times
    "adjustment_interval": int,     # Number of blocks between difficulty adjustments
    "time_tolerance": float         # Tolerance for block time deviation
}
```

#### Block Structure
```python
{
    "index": int,              # Block index in the chain
    "transactions": List[Dict], # List of transactions
    "timestamp": float,        # Block creation time
    "previous_hash": str,      # Hash of previous block
    "hash": str,              # Current block hash
    "nonce": int,             # Proof of work nonce
    "difficulty": int,        # Mining difficulty
    "merkle_root": str,       # Merkle root of transactions
    "merkle_tree": List[List[str]] # Complete Merkle tree for verification
}
```

#### Transaction Structure
```python
{
    "sender": str,     # Sender's address
    "recipient": str,  # Recipient's address
    "amount": float,   # Transaction amount
    "timestamp": float # Transaction creation time
}
```

#### Verification Results
```python
{
    "is_valid": bool,          # Whether the verification passed
    "tx_hash": str,           # Current transaction hash
    "merkle_root": str,       # Current Merkle root
    "computed_root": str,     # Computed Merkle root
    "modified_path": List[Dict], # Path to modified node if found
    "transaction": Dict       # The transaction being verified
}
```
